EMODMI:Network Based Disease Module Identification:An Evolutionary Multi-Objective Approach
===========================================================================================

**network_construct:constructs a sample-specific network for each disease sample to involve their personalized features;

**module_identify:optimizes not only the association of the module with the disease but also the intra-link density of the module by using a tailored multi-objective genetic algorithm
  *minimize:f1(x),f2(x)

**classify:evaluate the classification performance of the disease modules we identified;
